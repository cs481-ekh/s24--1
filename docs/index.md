# Descent

## Abstract:

The "Descent" project introduces a powerful Python-based tool designed to analyze extensive genealogical datasets from diverse communities. This program leverages sophisticated algorithms to perform detailed calculations that unveil historical patterns and relationships within the data. By synthesizing large volumes of genealogical entries, "Descent" facilitates a deeper understanding of familial ties, migration trends, and demographic changes over time. The insights generated by this tool are invaluable for researchers, historians, and community members seeking to trace lineage connections and explore their communal heritage in a structured and quantifiable manner. Moreover, "Descent" is built with scalability and adaptability in mind, enabling it to handle datasets of various sizes and complexities, making it a versatile asset in the field of historical and genealogical research.

## What We Actually Built:

In this project, we updated the "Descent" program, originally developed in 2005 using Python 2, for contemporary use on a Windows 11 system with Python 3. We were able to get the old version to operate on a Windows XP virtual machine, ensuring the integrity of the original software. We overhauled the outdated graphical user interface, replacing it with a modern GUI framework that enhances user interaction while maintaining the original layout and functionality. We upgraded the program's computational backend by integrating the Pandas data analysis library, which significantly boosts processing speed and efficiency. Most importantly, throughout these updates we were able to preserve the core functionality of "Descent," making alterations only where specifically required. We rigorously tested the updated program to confirm its full compatibility with Windows 11, thus ensuring that it meets current technological standards and user expectations.
